# Pothole Detection and Severity Classification using Computer Vision 


## The model can perform the following tasks: 

**a)** Detect potholes from Video and Image input with bounding boxes using the custom trained Yolov7 Object detection model. 

**b)** Crop and save the region of pothole from images as new image which can be used for further processing and analytics. 

**c)** Perform image processing and perspective transformation to enable improved contouring for area estimation. 

**d)** Use midas model (Robust Monocular Depth Estimation) for depth estimation of potholes. The value returned corresponds to the mean depth intensity which correlates to the Severity of the pothole in the image.
